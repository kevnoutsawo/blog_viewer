# Blog viewer app

### Setup instructions


- Clone repo
- npm install
- npm run Dev

## My approach:

I built a little service to fetch the data from the api. Then made a mapper to standardize the structre and include the properties that I use at the moment while keeping it easily extensible for future needs. I use typescript accross the project to limit type related errors and catch a maximum of bugs during compilation. I made some hooks to handle search, fetch user data for each post and store likes in the localStorage. I use ShadCN UI to quickly achieve a modern and accessible UI in no time. I handle the styling with Tailwind CSS and animations with Framer Motion and Numberflow for the animated rotating number effect.

##Â Bonus features:

- Search functionality
- Typescript
